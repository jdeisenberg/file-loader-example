# file-loader-example
Example of file-loader with ReasonReact.

Uses `file-loader` (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader) to 
allow `webpack` (https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle images along with
a ReasonReact component.

You will have to install `file-loader`:

```
npm install file-loader --save-dev
```
